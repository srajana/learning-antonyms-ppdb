# learning-antonyms-ppdb
This project involves Natural Language Processing and Learning techniques to learn antonyms using PPDB:The Paraphrase Database (http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~ccb/ppdb/).

The Abstract from this [paper](paper/paper_final.pdf):
Learning antonyms has widespread applications in natural language processing. This study focuses on antonymy detection using the Paraphrase Database (PPDB). We present a new automatic method of generating antonym pairs using paraphrase pairs obtained using PPDB. We describe a method for discovering these word pairs using a subset of PPDB phrases that indicate an antonym relationship between the target word pairs. This study can be extended to assign antonym relations to entries in PPDB.
